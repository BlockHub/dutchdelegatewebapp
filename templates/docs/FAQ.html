        <h4>Here we will expand on some questions we have received.</h4>

        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>
                <h5>How does the reward share frequency work?</h5>
                <p>
                    The standard frequency is set to weekly, meaning that after 7 days you can expect a reward share.

            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>Do you cover the voting and transaction fees?</h5>
                <p>
                    Yes we indeed cover the transaction fees for weekly and monthly payouts. If your payout is set to
                    monthly you receive an additional bonus of two times the transaction fee.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>If I have already voted, and then add more Ark to my wallet, will I need to vote again?</h5>
                <p>
                    No, once you have voted, that address is linked to the delegate.
                    You can add or remove Ark from your address whenever you want. Our server will know and adjust accordingly.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>Can I still obtain the early adopter status?</h5>
                <p>
                    If you have voted for us during the 100% payout period (from the 11th to the 24th of september)
                    you will receive early adopter status. If you transfer your wallet to a ledger, you can send us a request
                    to grant Early Adopter status to the new address
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>How much ark will I get when I vote for you?</h5>
                <p>
                    The community has developed many calculators, for example:
                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGo3FkC3uSWXGHatPQyny2brMWjAIJsHFCR-Lhkl_m0">Dafty</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The basic formula used is:

                        ((‘Your ark’ / ‘Total Ark voted for delegate’)* ‘share percentage’) * 422)
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>Why does the share on the calculator differ every day?</h5>
                <p>
                    That has to do with the ‘Total Ark voted for delegate’. This changes every day (or even more often) when people switch votes around.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>Is there a minimum share?</h5>
                <p>
                    For daily the minimum share is 2 ark, for weekly 0.1 Ark and for monthly 0.01 Ark. If your share
                    is lower than the minimum, you will receive a share as soon it crosses the threshold
                </p>
            </li>

        </ul>
