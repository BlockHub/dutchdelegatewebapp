<h2>Delegate Proposal</h2>

<p>
In this document we (Charles, Rudy, Rhmral) present our proposal for Dutchdelegate.
All three of us live in the Netherlands and are graduate students at the Radboud University.
Rudy and Rhmral both have a background in Information Sciences and Cyber Security.
Charles specializes in Data Science and Bioinformatics.
</p>

<h4>Our Proposal</h4>

<p>
As relatively early investors of Ark and as big fans of the Ecosystem,
we want to contribute more to the community as delegate by developing different programs and tools to
improve the voter’s experience. Furthermore, we organize meetups for Ark enthusiasts and attend developer blockchain meetups
where we promote the Ark Ecosystem.

What we have done since September:

Built an automated payout script that uses True Block Weight
(more information on this can be found in our blog).
Built a website: www.dutchdelegate.nl. Voters can create an account and set the payout to daily/weekly/monthly and
they can make use of the web application.
Built a web application where Ark holders can see statistics about forging, fund allocation, but also statistics about their own Ark funds.
For example: to aid in filing taxes.
Built an MVP graphql api implementation for Ark
Attended several blockchain meetups, such as the Ethereum developer meetup in Rotterdam the 4th of December.
Organized an Ark meetup in Nijmegen where one of the Ark team members attended.
</p>

<p>
What can voters expect:

We will continue to share 95% of our the blockreward.
Adresses that obtained an early adopter status will still receive 96% profit share.
We will continue to develop applications for the Ark Ecosystem, where voters can still give input on what
functionalities they would like to see.
We will continue to attend blockchain meetups and represent Ark.
We will represent Ark at the Cambridge University Hackathon.
We will organize an Ark meetup in Utrecht the 10th of February in collaboration with delegate ‘The Foundry’.
The profit share will never decrease, but might increase when the Ark to euro price increases. We will always try to be competitive and at the top of the profit share list.
As one can see, we will continue our contribution to the Ark community in many different aspects as delegate.

Kind regards,
The DutchDelegate team
